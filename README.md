## üöÄ The Objective: What is SYNAPSE?

Mental wellness tools often lack engagement, leading to low adherence. SYNAPSE is a research-informed prototype designed to address this gap by leveraging gamification and narrative therapy principles in a digital environment.

SYNAPSE offers users a series of guided conversations with distinct AI personas. Each interaction is designed to facilitate self-reflection and emotional processing in a safe, non-judgmental space. Our goal is to de-stigmatize mental self-care by making it as engaging and intuitive as a compelling visual novel.

## üí° Core Methodology: The Dual-Process Framework

The user experience is built upon a Dual-Process Framework, acknowledging that cognitive and emotional needs vary. The user can switch between two therapeutic modalities at any time.

*   ‚òÄÔ∏è **Cognitive Restructuring Mode (Day):** This mode utilizes principles from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The AI guides the user through logical, solution-focused dialogues to identify and challenge negative thought patterns, promoting a more positive and productive mindset.
*   üåô **Affective Labeling Mode (Night):** This mode draws from mindfulness and narrative therapy. In a calming, private setting, the AI encourages the user to articulate and explore their emotions. This process of "affective labeling" has been shown to reduce emotional distress and foster greater self-awareness.

## üß† Our Hypothesis: Narrative as a Vehicle for Change

Our central hypothesis is that interactive narrative is a powerful, yet underutilized, tool for positive behavioral change. By creating empathetic characters and meaningful choices, we can foster a strong user connection that encourages consistent use. SYNAPSE aims to prove that a well-told story can be one of the most effective pathways to understanding ourselves.

## üíª System Architecture: The Tech Behind the Simulation

This entire experience was architected with performance and elegance in mind, built from the ground up.

*   **Core Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3. No framework dependencies for maximum speed and control.
*   **Animation & Rendering:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is leveraged for all UI animations, ensuring a fluid, 60fps experience that feels native and responsive.
*   **State Management:** A custom-built finite state machine in Vanilla JS manages all scenes, user choices, and the complex logic of the Dual-Reality Engine.
*   **Data Persistence:** User progress, session states, and unlocked achievements ('Memories') are stored locally via the `localStorage` API, providing a seamless multi-session experience.
*   **Theming Engine:** A powerful and efficient theming system built on CSS variables allows for the instantaneous, global transformation between Day and Night modes.

## üéì Key Learnings & Iterations

The 5-day development sprint was an intense process of rapid prototyping and learning.
*   **The Power of a Solid Data Schema:** Engineering the core `story` object to be modular and theme-aware was the most critical architectural decision. It's the backbone that allows the Dual-Reality Engine to function.
*   **Stateful Logic in a Stateless World:** Building a robust state management system from scratch in JS was a masterclass in handling asynchronous events, user input, and narrative branching without memory leaks.
*   **Animation as a Core Feature:** I learned that animation isn't just decoration. In SYNAPSE, GSAP is used to communicate state changes, guide the user's focus, and create a palpable sense of atmosphere and immersion.
*   **User-Centric Design is Non-Negotiable:** Features like the skippable sequences and the intuitive save/load system were implemented after considering the user's journey. A great system anticipates the user's needs.

## üîß Deployment Protocol

No complex build process required.
1.  Clone this repository.
